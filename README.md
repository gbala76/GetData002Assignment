## Summary of assignment overview
This project is to demonstrate to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare a tidy data, based on the sample data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Note that, for a better performance, the sequence for transformation is:
* 1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* 2) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* 3) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
* 4) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* 5) Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Here are the files for the assignment:
 * [codebook.md](codebook.md) - this is the code book for the script.
 * [run_analysis.R](run_analysis.R) - this is the R script.
 * [resultTidy.txt](resultTidy.txt) - this is the output file. 

Please refer to the code book for more detailed documentation. 
Thanks
