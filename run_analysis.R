## The script is performing:
## 1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
## 2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
## 3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
## 4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
## 5) Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
